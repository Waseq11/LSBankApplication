Hello, this is an IOS Bank application that I made using XCODE on IOS. IT has login UI with validation. You can also create an account.I used CoreData to build the application. You can send money to  someone using the send option. However this is just a demo of the application and not real time. I used table view to create scene of the payees and you can add payee as well as use the Statement button to check the transactions of 30,60 and 90 days.
